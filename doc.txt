This document describes the outside view of the EUSB firmware within the
USBProg PIC programmer.


Firwmare versions

  EUSB 1, 4 February 2006

    Seems to work fully via serial interface.  USB not implemented yet,
    but can be powered from USB and communicate over serial.  Contains
    same PIC support as ProProg firmware PPRG 24 which was used as the
    base. Contains additional features made possible by this programmer
    hardware, like variable Vpp.  CPU runs at 48 MHz, DSETNS = 500,
    DSETTNS = 1000.  Programming a full 30F4011 takes 40.4 seconds.

  EUSB 2, 7 February 2006

    Fixed CLKOPC constant in UART module to be 80 instead of the 10
    accidentally left in last time for debugging.  This is the percent of
    the time from the start bit to the stop bit to time out in. After the
    timeout, if TXREG was empty on entry to the routine new writes are
    held off until TRMT becomes true.

  EUSB 3, 12 February 2006

    Temporary version to show the UART null byte output bug.  Only the
    UART_PUT routine was changed to remove the logic to work around the
    bug.  This version just waits for TXIF and writes the byte, and
    exhibits the null byte symptom.  This version of the source code was
    given to Microchip as a test case, although it probably won't be much
    help.

  EUSB 4, 12 February 2006

    Same as version 2 except the unused UART output FIFO was removed.  No
    functional changes from version 2 since the UART output FIFO was not
    used.

  EUSB 5, 3 June 2006

    Updated to EUSB2 board.  Some functions were moved to different I/O
    pins from the EUSB1 board.  Added switches in the project include file
    to disable USB, disable UART command input, and enable echoing USB
    enumeration requests over the serial port.

    Added general USB driver and enpoint 0 handler.  USB unumeration seems
    to work.  Very likely there is a bug in getting or sending data via
    the bulk endpoint 1.  There is also likely a bug where interrupts are
    corrupting USB enumeration response data.  Although the USB code has
    been tested, it is disabled in this version.

    This firmware now enables the switching power supplies.  The switching
    power supplies are started in the INIT module after the individual
    modules have been initialized.

    This version acts as a fully functional RS-232 programmer.  Uses 48
    MHz main oscillator frequency.  The following programming times in
    seconds were measured:

        PIC   Empty    Full
    -------   -----   -----
     16F876    15.6    51.8
     18F252    14.9    23.1
    18F2520    10.0    16.4
    30F3013    17.8    25.4
    30F4012    33.1    46.5

  EUSB 6, 4 June 2006

    For USB driver testing only.  Enumerates normally on USB, then copies
    any bytes received from endpoint 1 back to endpoint 1 unaltered.
    Received USB bytes are also echoed out the UART.  UART input is
    ignored.  PIC programmer function exists but there is no way to send
    it commands.

  EUSB 7, 11 June 2006

    Same as version 6 except fixed bug where USB output byte sometimes got
    corrupted.  Still contains workaround in USB0 to disable interrupts
    around processing a setup request.  Doesn't enumerate properly if
    interrupts are left on although it should.  Endpoint 1 input bytes are
    just echoed to endpoint 1 output.  The PIC programmer code is present
    but there is no way to send it commands. This version is for USB
    testing only.

  EUSB 8, 8 July 2006

    Implemented USB communication to the programmer functions for real.
    Bug fixed in enumeration where a byte sometimes got corrupted.  The
    workaround to disable interrupts around setup responses has been
    removed and all appears to work correctly.  USB endpoint 1 I/O is
    connected to programmer command processor and appears to work
    correctly, although this was tested only with low level test program
    that sends individual bytes manually and displays the raw received
    bytes.  Implements protocol spec version 20.

  EUSB 9, 6 August 2006

    Fixed bug in command processor where a byte was sometimes pushed onto
    the data stack without being popped if the input was coming from the
    USB.  USB programming is fully functional, although the programmer
    name and other non-volatile settings have not been implemented yet.
    The programmer name string always returns "This is a test" in this
    version.

    Readback from a target is significantly slower than the same
    operations performed over the serial port.  This is most likely due to
    sending then waiting to receive small amounts of data.  Writing large
    blocks of data (which requires no readback) to a 18F2520 was 11%
    faster than via the serial port.

  EUSB 10, 24 September 2006

    Added NAMESET and NAMEGET commands.  Non-volatile user-defined name
    not yet return for USB setup string 1.

  EUSB 11, 1 October 2006

    USB setup string 1 now returns the non-volatile user definable name.
    This allows the host driver to get and report the names of all
    USBProgs on the USB whether in use or not.  Implements protocol spec
    version 20.

  EUSB 12, 13 October 2006

    Moved the executable code of the NAME and PROM modules into included
    files, which are now also used by the PPRG firmware.  Added REBOOT
    command.  Implements protocol spec version 21.

  EUSB 13, 16 October 2006

    Added READ64 command.  Readback via USB is now almost as fast and
    sometimes even faster than via the serial port.

  EUSB 14, 25 January 2007

    Fixed bug that could cause hang on writing config word of 16F8xxA.

  EUSB 15, 27 January 2007

    Fixed device name and manufacturer name strings to be sent as Unicode
    instead of ASCII.

  EUSB 16, 27 January 2007

    Fixed bug where Vdd level might not be right until after first time
    Vdd is set to OFF from being something else.

  EUSB 17, 19 February 2007

    Added write ID 11, which is for 16F88x.  Implements protocol spec
    version 23.  Fixed bug where initialization of dsPIC target could have
    proceeded before Vpp had reached its final level.  Did not cause
    erroneous behaviour due to workaround in host software.  New versions
    of the host software do not have this workaround and therefore require
    this version or later.

  EUSB 18, 20 January 2008

    Added reset ID 6, which supports 18FJ PICs like the 18F25J10.  Added
    routine for generating a short blip on Vpp, as required by the reset
    procedure for the 18FJ devices.

  EUSB 19, 23 February 2008

    Changed timeout for waiting for Vpp to stabalize after voltage level
    change.  Was 100 ms, now 300 ms.

  EUSB 20, 2 May 2008

    Added reset ID 7, which supports dsPIC 24H and 33F.  Supports protocol
    spec 25.  Enhanced dsPIC reading and writing algorithms to support 24H
    and 33F.  The reset algorithm for 30F (ID 4) was changed so that the
    initial GOTO 100h is performed as part of the reset.  The new 24H and
    33F reset algorithm (ID 7) also does the initial GOTO.

  EUSB 21, 14 Feb 2009

    Special version that guarantees 5 us setup and hold time with respect
    to the falling edge of PGC.  This is a one-off version for special
    target hardware, and runs much slower than necessary for normal target
    hardware.

  EUSB 22, 22 Nov 2009

    Normal version.  Added support for 24F devices, including the new
    reset ID 8.

  EUSB 23 seq 11, 4 Jan 2011

    Added support for 16F182x.

  EUSB 24 seq 7, 19 Oct 2011

    Added support for 24FJ parts.  Fixed problem with 16F182x code.

  EUSB 25 seq 3, 1 Mar 2013

    One-off version that implements a slower 16F182x reset algorithm. This
    was done to make the programmer work with a particular piece of
    hardware that did not provide direct connections to the PIC lines, and
    the extra hardware was interfering.  In this version, a extra 400 ms
    wait is added after power up so that a reset supervisor chip allows
    MCLR to be driven high.  Then a 1 ms pulse on MCRL is done to put the
    processor in reset state ready to have the programming mode signature
    clocked in, regardless of what may have happened to PGC and PGD when
    power was applied.

    This version will function when the programmer is connected to all the
    programming lines normally, but will be slower.  It is not recommended
    for general use.

  EUSB 26 seq 15, 6 Feb 2015

    Added support for 18FxxK80.  Added serial protocol commands EECON1,
    EEADR, EEADRH, and EEDATA.  Added reset ID 11, which is the high
    voltage program entry mode for the 18FxxK80.  Updated to new USB
    subsystem include file scheme.  Same base source files as firmware
    LPRG 14.

  EUSB 27 seq 9, 12 Oct 2015

    Added support of non-volatile data memory for 12 bit core devices.
    DATADR must now be set for 12 bit core devices that have data memory.

  EUSB 28 seq 4, 24 Feb 2016

    Updated to protocol spec version 29.7, which adds support for 24/33 EP
    series parts.  This included adding reset ID 12, making addresses of
    various target registers configurable, and implementing the "fast
    tick" mechanism.

    Fast ticks are implemented as instruction cycles.  In this version,
    fast ticks are only used to time the wait after programming 2 words in
    a 24/33 EP series target PIC.

    IDRESET now causes various configurations to be reset to default.

    Same common code as LProg firmware LPRG 15.

  EUSB 29 seq 4, 14 Dec 2016

    Added ability to use the UART as a separate data port, controllable
    via the new commands SENDSER and RECVSER.  The new build switch
    CMDUART enables the UART as a host command source, versus available as
    a dataport.  The UART receive buffer was increased from 32 bytes to
    253 bytes.  When used as a data port, this is the number of received
    bytes the unit can store before additional received bytes are lost.
    This is 22 ms of data when there are no gaps between bytes.

    In this version, the UART is used as a data port, and can not receive
    host commands.

  EUSB 30 seq 1, 21 Dec 2016

    Fixed bugs in SENDSER and RECVSER commands.  These now delay their
    operation until any wait interval in progress elapses.

    In this version, the UART is used as a data port, and can not receive
    host commands.

  EUSB 31 seq 1, 28 Dec 2016

    Enabled the VPPHIZ command.  This was disabled in previous versions
    for some reason.

  EUSB 32 seq 12, 11 May 2018

    Updated to use new version of common PICPRG_F16E.INS.ASPIC library
    file with minor bug fix.

  EUSB 33 seq 23, 6 Jun 2018

    Added support for the new 16F programming algorithm that uses 8 bit
    opcodes and transfers all data in 24 bit words.  Added the 16FB module
    for that purpose.

    The 16F15313 is one example of a part that uses this programming
    protocol.

  EUSB 34 seq 43, 22 Oct 2018

    Added support for 16F183xx.  This was tested with a 16F18346.

    UART configuration is data port.

  EUSB 35 seq 4, 16 Mar 2019

    Same as EUSB 34, except the UART is configured as a command source.
    This is required for production of the USBProg or USBProg2 programmers
    since the tester interacts with the programmer over the UART port.

  EUSB 36 seq 10, 22 Aug 2021

    Added support for 16F152xx parts.

    Fixed some timing problems in code that supports the 16F PICs that use
    the 8-bit SPI interface.  These include the 16F152xx and 16F183xx
    families.

    UART configuration is command source.

  EUSB 37 seq 5, 17 Dec 2021

    Added reset ID 13, which supports low-voltage program mode entry for
    16F153xx.  Updated to reset tables bug fixed in common code.

    UART is data port, not command source.

  EUSB 38 seq 26, 9 Sep 2022

    Updated to new USB library code structure, which now requires using
    USB_SETUP.INS.ASPIC.

    Added detection of USB hardware getting wedged.  If so, resets USB,
    waits 1 second, then resets the processor.

    UART is data port, not command source.
